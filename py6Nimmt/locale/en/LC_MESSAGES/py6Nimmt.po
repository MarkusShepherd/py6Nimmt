"Rules\n"
"-----\n"
"\n"
"At each turn, each player selects a card to play, and put his card at the "
"end of one of the four rows on the table, following these rules:\n"
"\n"
"- The card must be put on a row where the latest (end) card is lower in "
"value than the card that is about to be played.\n"
"- The card must be put on the row where the latest (end) card is the closest "
"in value to the card that is about to be played (if your card is 33, then "
"place it next to the 30 not the 29, for example)\n"
"- If the row where the played card must be placed already contains 5 cards "
"(the players card is the 6th), the player must gather the 5 cards on the "
"table, leaving only the 6th card in their place to start a new row. The "
"gathered cards mustbe taken separated and never mixed with the hand cards. "
"The sum of the number of cattle head on the gathered cards will be "
"calculated at the end of the round.\n"
"- If the played card is lower than all the latest cards present on the four "
"rows, the player must choose a row and gather the cards on that row (usually "
"the row with the fewest cattle heads), leaving only the played card on the "
"row.\n"
"- The cards of all the players are played following these rules, from the "
"lowest player card to the highest one.\n"
"At the end of the turn, the players each select a new card to play; this is "
"repeated for 10 turns until all the cards in the hand are played.\n"
"After the 10 turns, each player counts the cattle heads on the cards "
"gathered from the table during the round.\n"
"The winner is the player who has collected the fewest cattle heads.\n"
"\n"
"Sample card:\n"
"------------\n"
"\n"
"004(01)\n"
"004 is card value and 01 is the number of cattle heads (in parentheses)."
